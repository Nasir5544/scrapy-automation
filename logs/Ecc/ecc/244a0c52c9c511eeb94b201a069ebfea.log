 'summary': 'Dear Trading Participants, dear Clearing Memberswith the '
            'publication of the Council Regulation (EU) 2022/2578 of 22 '
            'December 2022 (hereinafter “the Regulation”) on the so-called '
            'Market Correction Mechanism (MCM), there is a legal basis for a '
            'market intervention in the trading of gas market derivatives in '
            'the TTF derivatives taking effect as of 15 February 2023.As '
            'announced in our press release of 20 December 2022, we provide '
            'you with a more detailed overview of EEX/ECC´s understanding of '
            'the most important provisions of the Regulation and what changes '
            'are expected for trading and clearing at EEX and ECC. This '
            'understanding has been shared with the competent authorities of '
            'EEX and ECC but remains subject to orders or objections of said '
            'authorities or guidance from relevant European authorities. In '
            'due course, you will find more information in a Q&A which will be '
            'published soon and thereafter updated regularly. The MCM is '
            'triggered by the following factors in regulated exchange natural '
            'gas market trading (referred to as a market correction event): '
            'The settlement price for derivatives trading in natural gas in '
            'the TTF Front Month contract, published by ICE Endex B.V., the '
            'Netherlands, exceeds a price of 180 EUR/MWh on three consecutive '
            'working days and is 35 EUR/MWh above the global LNG reference '
            'price calculated by ACER during that period. If this is the case, '
            'ACER shall publish on its website by 23:59 CET at the latest a '
            'notice of the occurrence of a market correction event (market '
            'correction notice).As of the day after the publication of the '
            'market correction notice, a so-called dynamic bidding limit for '
            'TTF derivatives with certain maturities takes effect. More '
            'specifically, TTF derivatives market participants shall not '
            'submit and market operators shall not accept orders for TTF '
            'derivatives that are due to expire in the period from the expiry '
            'date of the front-month TTF derivative to the expiry date of the '
            'front-year TTF derivative with prices of 35 EUR/MWh above the '
            'reference price published by ACER on the previous day. If the '
            'reference price falls below 145 EUR/MWh, the dynamic bidding '
            'limit shall remain at the sum of 145 EUR/MWh + 35 EUR/MWh, i.e. '
            'EUR 180 EUR/MWh.This means that the dynamic bidding limit may '
            'change in correlation to the reference price if the LNG reference '
            'price is above 145 EUR/MWh (dynamic bidding limit = LNG reference '
            'price + 35 EUR/MWh) and remains static at a price of 180 EUR/MWh '
            'if the LNG reference price is lower than 145 EUR/MWh.Unless the '
            'EU Commission suspends the MCM or declares a regional or Union '
            'emergency, the dynamic bidding limit will be deactivated at the '
            'earliest after 20 working days if the LNG reference price is '
            'below 145 EUR/MWh for three consecutive working days. ACER will '
            'publish a corresponding deactivation notice.PRODUCTSThe MCM '
            'applies to all TTF futures (i.e. EEX TTF Natural Gas Futures and '
            'EEX TTF EGSI Futures) that expire between the expiry date of the '
            'front month and the expiry date of the front year, including all '
            'months (from M+1 onwards), quarter and season contracts that '
            'expire during that time and the front-year contract itself. '
            'Maturities shorter than one month are not in scope of the '
            'Regulation. Such shorter maturities exist only for the '
            'financially settled TTF EGSI Futures as day, weekend and week '
            'contracts. A timetable reflecting the maturities affected by any '
            'potential market correction event will be attached as Annex to '
            'the Q&As.Options on TTF futures are TTF derivatives, but the '
            'Regulation does not restrict option pricing. Options trading '
            'therefore remains unaffected. Nevertheless, as long as a dynamic '
            'bidding limit applies, EEX will not list new option series with a '
            'strike price above the applicable dynamic bidding limit. Please '
            'note that EEX currently does not offer any option series with '
            'strike prices above a potential bidding limit.TRADINGWith the '
            'activation of the dynamic bidding limit, trading participants may '
            'not submit and EEX will no longer accept orders for the affected '
            'contracts beyond the dynamic bidding limit. Unless an exemption '
            'under Article 12 (4) of the Regulation applies, orders above the '
            'dynamic price limit (including potential trades) will be manually '
            'cancelled by the market operations team.Exemptions under Article '
            '12 (4) include for example buying and selling TTF derivatives to '
            'offset or reduce TTF derivatives contracts concluded before 1 '
            'February 2023. As EEX and ECC cannot check the date of conclusion '
            'of a TTF position, we will rely on the correctness of the '
            'information provided by the trading participants. In order to '
            'make use of an exemption, trading participants must enter the '
            'relevant information in the respective text field upon order '
            'entry. If an order above the dynamic bidding limit does not '
            'contain corresponding information, it will be treated as a normal '
            'order entry and EEX will delete this order and corresponding '
            'trades. The requirements for an exception must be met on both '
            'sides of a trade. Further instructions will follow in this '
            'regard.DAILY SETTLEMENT PRICESThe EEX settlement price '
            'determination procedure will continue to apply without changes, '
            'as settlement prices are not subject to the prohibition of '
            'Article 4 (5) of the Regulation. The settlement price procedure '
            'has always considered not only trading activity on the regulated '
            'market, but also fair values provided by market participants and '
            'data from sources outside EEX. This means that settlement prices '
            'will continue to reflect the proper fair market value, '
            'irrespective of whether a dynamic bidding limit applies. Please '
            'find EEX’ Settlement Pricing Procedure here.CLEARINGThe '
            'availability of daily settlement prices reflecting fair market '
            'value is the basis for key risk management processes for ECC, '
            'Clearing Members and Trading Participants. EEX continues to '
            'provide fair market values even if a dynamic bidding limit '
            'applies. In addition, default management auctions of ECC do not '
            'fall under the MCM. The registration of the auction results on '
            'EEX’ regulated market is explicitly permitted by Article 12 (4) '
            '(c) of the Regulation.Hence, no material changes to the approved '
            'and established clearing processes are required:Both the '
            'calculation of initial margins and the regular variation margin '
            'process will remain unchanged without cap interference. If '
            'participants accumulate very large positions or the market volume '
            'is significantly reduced, resulting in an increased concentration '
            'risk, the concentration risk margin increases. This is in line '
            'with the existing and established procedure to calculate '
            'concentration risk margins.The general procedure for intraday '
            'exposure management will not change either. Intraday margin calls '
            'are calculated during the day based on price signals from '
            'transactions. Depending on the number of transactions, ECC might '
            'additionally use price signals from other sources (e.g. OTFs or '
            'OTC) to complement those price signals.Nevertheless, as the '
            'Regulation might impact market behavior, ECC will continue to '
            'assess the adequacy of its risk management systems. ECC will '
            'intensify its monitoring of inter alia volumes, prices and '
            'liquidity to detect any potential developments at an early stage '
            'and implement changes if required according to its established '
            'change management procedures.OTFThe EEX Organised Trading '
            'Facility (EEX OTF) is not covered by the Regulation and remains '
            'unaffected by any potential market correction event as the '
            'Regulation exclusively limits the MCM to regulated markets '
            '(Article 4(5) and definition of “TTF Derivative” in Article 2(1) '
            'of the Regulation). To recall, an OTF is a MiFID II regulated '
            'trading venue that is not a regulated market. The EEX OTF had '
            'been established in 2016, when it was still called a non-MTF. '
            'With the entry into force of MiFiD II, EEX was granted an OTF '
            'license.At the EEX OTF, TTF Natural Gas Futures are listed which '
            'are contractually identical to the EEX Regulated Market TTF '
            'Futures. The EEX OTF offers order and trade based intraday and '
            'settlement price information and continues to be a transparent '
            'and supervised trading venue with secure and safe clearing at '
            'ECC. Article 9 of the Regulation provides for the extension of '
            'the MCM to derivatives linked to other VTPs by means of a '
            'Commission Implementing Act. In the future, the full set of EEX '
            'Regulated Market Natural Gas products will be provided on EEX '
            'OTF.The EEX OTF allows market participants and clearing members '
            'to manage existing regulated market positions unrestricted from '
            'the MCM. In the future, Clearing Members and Non-Clearing Members '
            'can request, for risk reduction purposes, a compression (netting '
            'by novation) with regards to futures transactions in natural gas '
            'futures concluded on two different markets (e.g. EEX Regulated '
            'Market and EEX OTF). By this compression - each subject to ECC´ '
            'confirmation - Clearing Members and Market participants will be '
            'enabled to not only economically but also legally offset '
            'regulated market futures positions in Natural Gas derivatives.All '
            'trading participants that are admitted for trading in EEX Natural '
            'Gas Futures at EEX Regulated Market and that have provided access '
            'to the relevant balancing agreement(s) will be set-up by EEX on '

            'which the core elements are as follows:The CCPRRR requires ECC to '
            'introduce a SSITG as an additional dedicated, pre-funded\xa0own '
            'financial resource. It must have a volume between 10% and 25% of '
            'the regulatory capital requirements (Art. 9 No. 14 CCPRRR). The '
            'general target of the SSITG as formulated\xa0in the CCPRRR is to '
            'align incentives between the CCP and its members in case of '
            'unfunded financial contributions from members in a recovery '
            'situation.\xa0This additional financial resource shall only be '
            'applied if ECC is in a recovery situation\xa0(Art. 9 No. 14 and '
            'Annex A No. 15 CCPRRR). This means, ECC’s financial viability '
            'must\xa0be significantly threatened and the need to apply '
            'recovery tools is indicated.\xa0The SSITG must be applied before '
            'ECC resorts to certain recovery tools, especially if\xa0these '
            'tools require financial contributions from clearing members or '
            'clients (Rect. 22\xa0CCPRRR) or restructure contracts (Annex A '
            'No. 15 CCPRRR). The tools foreseen in the\xa0recovery plan that '
            'require financial contributions, directly or indirectly, from '
            'members are\xa0the additional contributions to the default fund '
            '(‘assessment cash calls’), forced position\xa0allocation, partial '
            'tear-up and distribution of investment losses.Under the current '
            'rulebook, ECC already contributes additional funds to its '
            'dedicated own\xa0resources (the first Skin-in-the-Game) on a '
            'pro-rata basis with the remaining clearing\xa0members additional '
            'contributions to the default fund. The current rule foresees up '
            'to three\xa0times ECC’s first Skin-in-the-Game over a cool-down '
            'period of 90 days. For a single default\xa0one time ECC’s first '
            'Skin-in-the-Game is considered.With the introduction of the '
            'SSITG, ECC will place an additional pre-funded contribution\xa0'
            'before the clearing members additional contribution '
            '(“assessments”). ECC intends to\xa0change the current additional '
            'contribution of ECC to an “additional voluntary contribution”\xa0'
            'with the same calculation key, but limit it to a total fixed EUR '
            'amount over a cool-down\xa0period of currently 90 days and '
            'covering single or multiple default events.Overall, the incentive '
            'structure is further strengthened. The SSITG is a pre-funded '
            'first\xa0loss tranche before clearing member additional '
            'contributions. Setting the additional voluntary contribution of '
            'ECC to a fixed amount supports transparency on ECC’s committed\xa0'
            'financial resources and the pro-rata calculation ensures a strong '
            'incentive structure also\xa0at the later stages of the default '
            'waterfall.The target of recovery tools is to maintain ECC’s '
            'financial viability. From a regulatory perspective,\xa0this '
            'includes regulatory capital requirements calculated in accordance '
            'with Article 16(2) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012. Therefore, the '
            'SSITG should support the\xa0maintenance of the regulatory capital '
            'in any recovery situation and not be restricted as a\xa0side '
            'condition before application of other recovery tools imposing '
            'obligations to external\xa0stakeholders.The requirement in the '
            'CCPRRR to use SSITG as first loss tranche before loss '
            'distribution\xa0to clearing members in a recovery situation makes '
            'adaption of the current loss distribution regulation regarding '
            'investment losses in ECC’s rulebook necessary.\xa0For investment '
            'losses resulting from the investment of cash collateral, loss '
            'distribution is\xa0currently regulated per currency as a pro-rata '
            'approach between ECC and the relevant\xa0clearing members. For a '
            'clearing member, the loss contribution is limited to its total '
            'provided\xa0cash collateral per relevant currency. ECC’s total '
            'contribution is limited to 5 Mn.\xa0EUR (see ECCs Clearing '
            'Conditions, section 3.4.6).\xa0This rule remains unchanged for '
            'situations where losses from cash investments are low\xa0and '
            'ECC’s financial viability is not threatened. The SSITG will not '
            'be applied, because\xa0the SSITG is reserved under the CCPRRR for '
            'recovery situations only. ECC’s contribution will remain on a '
            'pro-rata basis in non-recovery situations.\xa0For recovery '
            'situations, the loss distribution of investment losses would '
            'change. ECC retains\xa0the first loss piece with its SSITG. '
            'Thereafter, ECC can require clearing members to\xa0bear the '
            'remaining losses equivalently to the current distribution key, '
            'e.g. pro-rata per\xa0accepted cash collateral currency based on '
            'the amount provided by the clearing members.\xa0The loss '
            'contribution to a clearing member would at no time exceed the '
            'amount\xa0provided in cash as collateral and default fund '
            'contribution in the currency affected by the\xa0loss.Questions to '

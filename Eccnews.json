The change will become effective on 1 September 2023 based on the end-of-day values from 31 August 2023. The current allocation of Default Fund Contributions consider the Clearing Members initial margin history over a one year lookback period and the EMIR Netting Cap to consider the portfolio margin restrictions in Article 27 of the EMIR RTS 153/2013. The new total Default Fund will be based on the average daily stress test results over the last month increased by a buffer of 30%. The total Default Fund will be capped at 10% of the average total initial margin (IM) over the last month.The Default Fund Contribution will be calculated as proportional share of the Total Default Fund based on the Clearing Member’s equally weighted average IM and stress loss over intiital margin (SLOIM) share. A minimum of 2% based on the average Clearing Member IM is applied. There is no change to the monthly update frequency of the Default Fund Contributions.If the daily cover-2 stress test scenario result exceeds a share of the total Default Fund, the excess cover-2 exposure is mitigated via Supplementary Margin call. The Supplementary Margin process will remain unchanged. The EMIR Netting Cap will be removed and will be directly integrated into the IM calculation. The applied margin credits will be capped at 80% for contracts that are considered to be different products according to the ESMA opinion. For details regarding the Default Fund methodology and the Supplementary Margin process please refer to the “Default Fund and Supplementary Margin Methodology” documentation on the ECC website. For details regarding the portfolio margining cap please refer to the “ECC Margining document” on the ECC website. All parameters are subject to regular review. The applicable values will be published on ECCs website. Augustusplatz 9, 04109 Leipzig, Germany t: +49 341 24680-0a member ofa member ofWe use cookies on our website.

Trading Participants/Exchange Traders newly set up for EEX OTF Natural Gas Derivatives (as described above) will be set up with the respective Standard Transaction Size Limits. All trading participants with T7 GUI administrators have the possibility to define ETSLs or to disable certain products by setting ETSLs with value “0”.Trading participants without own administrators please contact their EEX Key Account Manager via sales@eex.com. Please let us know in case the EEX OTF Natural Gas Derivatives shall not be added to your membership by sending an e-mail to membership@eex.com by 7 March 2023. As a precondition for admission at the EEX OTF as described above, the respective Clearing Member must declare its consent to ECC by 31 March 2023. This is centrally coordinated by ECC. Please liaise with your Clearing Member directly in case of any questions. Once processed in the system each affected Trading Participant will receive the admission approval by e-mail. All EEX OTF Natural Gas Derivatives with delivery periods as of 1 April 2023 that comprise mandatory physical delivery (“must be physically settled”) will be changed to EEX OTF Natural Gas Derivatives with optional physical settlement (can be physically settled according to MiFiD definition). This also applies to the future EEX OTF Natural Gas Derivatives for the market areas CZ VTP and PVB.Optional physical settlement means that a position in an EEX OTF Natural Gas Derivative may be closed by a counter transaction prior to the beginning of delivery period. Positions held beyond that point in time will be physically delivered in accordance with ECC standard processes. For Trading Participants without the capability of physical delivery, the obligations from the Close-out Agreement will also cover the EEX OTF Natural Gas Derivatives.Please note that EEX OTF Natural Gas Derivatives with optional physical settlement are subject to transparency and reporting requirements under MiFID II, MiFIR, EMIR, MAR and REMIT. The relevant MiFID/MiFIR Data Services Agreement, EMIR Data Services Agreement and REMIT Data Service Agreement cover both EEX Regulated Market and EEX OTF. In relation to clients that have these agreements in place the respective services will automatically be extended to these products. The additional EEX OTF Natural Gas Derivatives will be set up as follows in the ECC clearing system:HEBM   EEX PVB Natural Gas Month OTF Future EEX_FT_NATGAS_PVB_OTF  Delivery Product Group:  EEX_FE_NATGAS_PVB HEBQ EEX PVB Natural Gas Quarter OTF Future HEBS EEX PVB Natural Gas Season OTF Future HEBY EEX PVB Natural Gas Year OTF Future H1BM EEX CZ VTP Natural Gas Month OTF Future EEX_FT_NATGAS_OTE_OTF  Delivery Product Group:  EEX_FE_NATGAS_OTE  H1BQ EEX CZ VTP Natural Gas Quarter OTF Future H1BS EEX CZ VTP Natural Gas Season OTF Future H1BY EEX CZ VTP Natural Gas Year OTF Future  Detailed information on the product setup will be provided in the EEX OTF Contract Specifications and in the ECC Contract Detail File shortly.The transactions will be imported into the derivative clearing system C7 of ECC and integrated into the standard clearing processes for EEX OTF Natural Gas Derivatives. Transactions are included in the regular data streams and reports. In addition, transactions can be retrieved via the ECC Member Area on the next ECC business day after 9:30 am CE(S)T. The transactions are processed in the ECC settlement system SMSS for invoicing purposes using the product groups mentioned above.Corresponding Natural Gas Futures listed on the EEX Regulated Market and on the EEX OTF have the same risk profile as defined by ECC Risk Management standards.

This understanding has been shared with the competent authorities of EEX and ECC but remains subject to orders or objections of said authorities or guidance from relevant European authorities. In due course, you will find more information in a Q&A which will be published soon and thereafter updated regularly. The MCM is triggered by the following factors in regulated exchange natural gas market trading (referred to as a market correction event): The settlement price for derivatives trading in natural gas in the TTF Front Month contract, published by ICE Endex B.V., the Netherlands, exceeds a price of 180 EUR/MWh on three consecutive working days and is 35 EUR/MWh above the global LNG reference price calculated by ACER during that period. If this is the case, ACER shall publish on its website by 23:59 CET at the latest a notice of the occurrence of a market correction event (market correction notice).As of the day after the publication of the market correction notice, a so-called dynamic bidding limit for TTF derivatives with certain maturities takes effect. More specifically, TTF derivatives market participants shall not submit and market operators shall not accept orders for TTF derivatives that are due to expire in the period from the expiry date of the front-month TTF derivative to the expiry date of the front-year TTF derivative with prices of 35 EUR/MWh above the reference price published by ACER on the previous day. If the reference price falls below 145 EUR/MWh, the dynamic bidding limit shall remain at the sum of 145 EUR/MWh + 35 EUR/MWh, i.e. EUR 180 EUR/MWh.This means that the dynamic bidding limit may change in correlation to the reference price if the LNG reference price is above 145 EUR/MWh (dynamic bidding limit = LNG reference price + 35 EUR/MWh) and remains static at a price of 180 EUR/MWh if the LNG reference price is lower than 145 EUR/MWh.Unless the EU Commission suspends the MCM or declares a regional or Union emergency, the dynamic bidding limit will be deactivated at the earliest after 20 working days if the LNG reference price is below 145 EUR/MWh for three consecutive working days. ACER will publish a corresponding deactivation notice.PRODUCTSThe MCM applies to all TTF futures (i.e. EEX TTF Natural Gas Futures and EEX TTF EGSI Futures) that expire between the expiry date of the front month and the expiry date of the front year, including all months (from M+1 onwards), quarter and season contracts that expire during that time and the front-year contract itself. Maturities shorter than one month are not in scope of the Regulation. Such shorter maturities exist only for the financially settled TTF EGSI Futures as day, weekend and week contracts. A timetable reflecting the maturities affected by any potential market correction event will be attached as Annex to the Q&As.Options on TTF futures are TTF derivatives, but the Regulation does not restrict option pricing. Options trading therefore remains unaffected. Nevertheless, as long as a dynamic bidding limit applies, EEX will not list new option series with a strike price above the applicable dynamic bidding limit. Please note that EEX currently does not offer any option series with strike prices above a potential bidding limit.TRADINGWith the activation of the dynamic bidding limit, trading participants may not submit and EEX will no longer accept orders for the affected contracts beyond the dynamic bidding limit. Unless an exemption under Article 12 (4) of the Regulation applies, orders above the dynamic price limit (including potential trades) will be manually cancelled by the market operations team.Exemptions under Article 12 (4) include for example buying and selling TTF derivatives to offset or reduce TTF derivatives contracts concluded before 1 February 2023. As EEX and ECC cannot check the date of conclusion of a TTF position, we will rely on the correctness of the information provided by the trading participants. In order to make use of an exemption, trading participants must enter the relevant information in the respective text field upon order entry. If an order above the dynamic bidding limit does not contain corresponding information, it will be treated as a normal order entry and EEX will delete this order and corresponding trades. The requirements for an exception must be met on both sides of a trade. Further instructions will follow in this regard.DAILY SETTLEMENT PRICESThe EEX settlement price determination procedure will continue to apply without changes, as settlement prices are not subject to the prohibition of Article 4 (5) of the Regulation. The settlement price procedure has always considered not only trading activity on the regulated market, but also fair values provided by market participants and data from sources outside EEX. This means that settlement prices will continue to reflect the proper fair market value, irrespective of whether a dynamic bidding limit applies. Please find EEX’ Settlement Pricing Procedure here.CLEARINGThe availability of daily settlement prices reflecting fair market value is the basis for key risk management processes for ECC, Clearing Members and Trading Participants. EEX continues to provide fair market values even if a dynamic bidding limit applies. In addition, default management auctions of ECC do not fall under the MCM. The registration of the auction results on EEX’ regulated market is explicitly permitted by Article 12 (4) (c) of the Regulation.Hence, no material changes to the approved and established clearing processes are required:Both the calculation of initial margins and the regular variation margin process will remain unchanged without cap interference. If participants accumulate very large positions or the market volume is significantly reduced, resulting in an increased concentration risk, the concentration risk margin increases. This is in line with the existing and established procedure to calculate concentration risk margins.The general procedure for intraday exposure management will not change either. Intraday margin calls are calculated during the day based on price signals from transactions. Depending on the number of transactions, ECC might additionally use price signals from other sources (e.g. OTFs or OTC) to complement those price signals.Nevertheless, as the Regulation might impact market behavior, ECC will continue to assess the adequacy of its risk management systems. ECC will intensify its monitoring of inter alia volumes, prices and liquidity to detect any potential developments at an early stage and implement changes if required according to its established change management procedures.OTFThe EEX Organised Trading Facility (EEX OTF) is not covered by the Regulation and remains unaffected by any potential market correction event as the Regulation exclusively limits the MCM to regulated markets (Article 4(5) and definition of “TTF Derivative” in Article 2(1) of the Regulation). To recall, an OTF is a MiFID II regulated trading venue that is not a regulated market. The EEX OTF had been established in 2016, when it was still called a non-MTF. With the entry into force of MiFiD II, EEX was granted an OTF license.At the EEX OTF, TTF Natural Gas Futures are listed which are contractually identical to the EEX Regulated Market TTF Futures. The EEX OTF offers order and trade based intraday and settlement price information and continues to be a transparent and supervised trading venue with secure and safe clearing at ECC. Article 9 of the Regulation provides for the extension of the MCM to derivatives linked to other VTPs by means of a Commission Implementing Act. In the future, the full set of EEX Regulated Market Natural Gas products will be provided on EEX OTF.The EEX OTF allows market participants and clearing members to manage existing regulated market positions unrestricted from the MCM. In the future, Clearing Members and Non-Clearing Members can request, for risk reduction purposes, a compression (netting by novation) with regards to futures transactions in natural gas futures concluded on two different markets (e.g. EEX Regulated Market and EEX OTF). By this compression - each subject to ECC´ confirmation - Clearing Members and Market participants will be enabled to not only economically but also legally offset regulated market futures positions in Natural Gas derivatives.All trading participants that are admitted for trading in EEX Natural Gas Futures at EEX Regulated Market and that have provided access to the relevant balancing agreement(s) will be set-up by EEX on the EEX OTF accordingly.Further information will follow in due course.

The final approach to the Second-Skin-in-the-Game and its application will be consulted with the EMIR Risk Committee before implementation. The final rulebook changes will be subject to the standard consultation process for changes in ECC’s rulebook before becoming effective.The EU-Regulation 2021/23 (CCPRRR) foresees introduction of additional, pre-funded dedicated own resources (aka ‘Second Skin-in-the-Game’ - SSITG) as a specific, additional loss tranche to be applied in situations where ECC’s experiences ‘a significant deterioration of its financial situation or a risk of breaching its capital and prudential requirements’ (so called ‘recovery situations’) according to Art. 9 (1) CCPRRR. The SSITG is an addition to the EMIR default waterfall for default events and a first loss tranche in non-default events (Art. 9 No. 14 CCPRRR). The introduction of the SSITG is a step to align ECC’s recovery toolkit with the requirements of the CCPRRR. The amount of ECC’s SSITG to be pre-funded is subject to the decision of ECC’s Management Board. The amount of the SSITG will always, at a minimum, correspond to the amount required under Art. 9. (14) and (15) CCPRRR and the accompanying RTS of the EU Commission regarding maintenance and calculation of the SSITG. ECC will not take the SSITG from the existing dedicated own resources, but fully dedicate additional own capital for the SSITG. Regarding the governance structure, the application of all recovery tools, including the SSITG, is subject to the decision of ECC’s Management Board. Recovery tools posing obligations to Clearing Members are specified in ECC’s rulebook. ECC’s regulatory authority is informed before application of any recovery tool(s). In addition, ECC’s regulatory authority can require ECC to abstain from utilization of any recovery tool, or require ECC to apply a tool under CCPRRRR.The introduction of the SSITG makes several changes to ECCs rulebook necessary, of which the core elements are as follows:The CCPRRR requires ECC to introduce a SSITG as an additional dedicated, pre-funded own financial resource. It must have a volume between 10% and 25% of the regulatory capital requirements (Art. 9 No. 14 CCPRRR). The general target of the SSITG as formulated in the CCPRRR is to align incentives between the CCP and its members in case of unfunded financial contributions from members in a recovery situation. This additional financial resource shall only be applied if ECC is in a recovery situation (Art. 9 No. 14 and Annex A No. 15 CCPRRR). This means, ECC’s financial viability must be significantly threatened and the need to apply recovery tools is indicated. The SSITG must be applied before ECC resorts to certain recovery tools, especially if these tools require financial contributions from clearing members or clients (Rect. 22 CCPRRR) or restructure contracts (Annex A No. 15 CCPRRR). The tools foreseen in the recovery plan that require financial contributions, directly or indirectly, from members are the additional contributions to the default fund (‘assessment cash calls’), forced position allocation, partial tear-up and distribution of investment losses.Under the current rulebook, ECC already contributes additional funds to its dedicated own resources (the first Skin-in-the-Game) on a pro-rata basis with the remaining clearing members additional contributions to the default fund. The current rule foresees up to three times ECC’s first Skin-in-the-Game over a cool-down period of 90 days. For a single default one time ECC’s first Skin-in-the-Game is considered.With the introduction of the SSITG, ECC will place an additional pre-funded contribution before the clearing members additional contribution (“assessments”). ECC intends to change the current additional contribution of ECC to an “additional voluntary contribution” with the same calculation key, but limit it to a total fixed EUR amount over a cool-down period of currently 90 days and covering single or multiple default events.Overall, the incentive structure is further strengthened. The SSITG is a pre-funded first loss tranche before clearing member additional contributions. Setting the additional voluntary contribution of ECC to a fixed amount supports transparency on ECC’s committed financial resources and the pro-rata calculation ensures a strong incentive structure also at the later stages of the default waterfall.The target of recovery tools is to maintain ECC’s financial viability. From a regulatory perspective, this includes regulatory capital requirements calculated in accordance with Article 16(2) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012. Therefore, the SSITG should support the maintenance of the regulatory capital in any recovery situation and not be restricted as a side condition before application of other recovery tools imposing obligations to external stakeholders.The requirement in the CCPRRR to use SSITG as first loss tranche before loss distribution to clearing members in a recovery situation makes adaption of the current loss distribution regulation regarding investment losses in ECC’s rulebook necessary. For investment losses resulting from the investment of cash collateral, loss distribution is currently regulated per currency as a pro-rata approach between ECC and the relevant clearing members. For a clearing member, the loss contribution is limited to its total provided cash collateral per relevant currency. ECC’s total contribution is limited to 5 Mn. EUR (see ECCs Clearing Conditions, section 3.4.6). This rule remains unchanged for situations where losses from cash investments are low and ECC’s financial viability is not threatened. The SSITG will not be applied, because the SSITG is reserved under the CCPRRR for recovery situations only. ECC’s contribution will remain on a pro-rata basis in non-recovery situations. For recovery situations, the loss distribution of investment losses would change. ECC retains the first loss piece with its SSITG. Thereafter, ECC can require clearing members to bear the remaining losses equivalently to the current distribution key, e.g. pro-rata per accepted cash collateral currency based on the amount provided by the clearing members. The loss contribution to a clearing member would at no time exceed the amount provided in cash as collateral and default fund contribution in the currency affected by the loss.Questions to participants ECC welcomes any feedback to this consultation which any interested party can give until 16th of September via the following survey link: ECC consultation on Recovery Tools () Augustusplatz 9, 04109 Leipzig, Germany t: +49 341 24680-0a member ofa member ofWe use cookies on our website.

To support our trading and clearing members in their efforts, we have established a Brexit Working Group to support your Key Account Managers to guide and assist you through any required preparations, whether in terms of relocation to the EU27 or organisational restructuring to fit the new realities. With a view to maintaining access to our trading and clearing services for UK and EU27 customers in commodities trading, EPEX SPOT, EEX, Powernext and ECC are in contact with relevant regulators to discuss authorisations requirements post Brexit and to prepare accordingly. We encourage our customers to plan with all scenarios in mind, cognisant that the future relationship between the UK and EU, in particular the legal framework for cross-border services, are yet to be agreed. Lacking a ratified withdrawal agreement between the UK and EU, all EU law will cease to apply to the UK from 30 March 2019 and the UK will then become a 'third country' with legal repercussions as set out in notices of the EU Commission published on 8 February 2018. EEX Group regulated in the European Union with an EMIR licensed CCP is best positioned to cover customer needs post-Brexit in an existing and known regulatory framework.

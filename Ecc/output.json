The change will become effective on 1 September 2023 based on the end-of-day values from 31 August 2023. The current allocation of Default Fund Contributions consider the Clearing Members initial margin history over a one year lookback period and the EMIR Netting Cap to consider the portfolio margin restrictions in Article 27 of the EMIR RTS 153/2013. The new total Default Fund will be based on the average daily stress test results over the last month increased by a buffer of 30%. The total Default Fund will be capped at 10% of the average total initial margin (IM) over the last month.The Default Fund Contribution will be calculated as proportional share of the Total Default Fund based on the Clearing Member’s equally weighted average IM and stress loss over intiital margin (SLOIM) share. A minimum of 2% based on the average Clearing Member IM is applied. There is no change to the monthly update frequency of the Default Fund Contributions.If the daily cover-2 stress test scenario result exceeds a share of the total Default Fund, the excess cover-2 exposure is mitigated via Supplementary Margin call. The Supplementary Margin process will remain unchanged. The EMIR Netting Cap will be removed and will be directly integrated into the IM calculation. The applied margin credits will be capped at 80% for contracts that are considered to be different products according to the ESMA opinion. For details regarding the Default Fund methodology and the Supplementary Margin process please refer to the “Default Fund and Supplementary Margin Methodology” documentation on the ECC website. For details regarding the portfolio margining cap please refer to the “ECC Margining document” on the ECC website. All parameters are subject to regular review. The applicable values will be published on ECCs website. Augustusplatz 9, 04109 Leipzig, Germany t: +49 341 24680-0a member ofa member ofWe use cookies on our website.

ECC is planning to change the approach to calculate the “Holiday Adjustment”. The change will be considered for the first time in the margin calculation before the Labor Day holiday 01 May 2023 (IMSM Calculation Date 27 April 2023, resp. 28 April 2023, for the margin effective 28 April 2023, resp. 02 May 2023).

Trading Participants/Exchange Traders newly set up for EEX OTF Natural Gas Derivatives (as described above) will be set up with the respective Standard Transaction Size Limits. All trading participants with T7 GUI administrators have the possibility to define ETSLs or to disable certain products by setting ETSLs with value “0”.Trading participants without own administrators please contact their EEX Key Account Manager via sales@eex.com. Please let us know in case the EEX OTF Natural Gas Derivatives shall not be added to your membership by sending an e-mail to membership@eex.com by 7 March 2023. As a precondition for admission at the EEX OTF as described above, the respective Clearing Member must declare its consent to ECC by 31 March 2023. This is centrally coordinated by ECC. Please liaise with your Clearing Member directly in case of any questions. Once processed in the system each affected Trading Participant will receive the admission approval by e-mail. All EEX OTF Natural Gas Derivatives with delivery periods as of 1 April 2023 that comprise mandatory physical delivery (“must be physically settled”) will be changed to EEX OTF Natural Gas Derivatives with optional physical settlement (can be physically settled according to MiFiD definition). This also applies to the future EEX OTF Natural Gas Derivatives for the market areas CZ VTP and PVB.Optional physical settlement means that a position in an EEX OTF Natural Gas Derivative may be closed by a counter transaction prior to the beginning of delivery period. Positions held beyond that point in time will be physically delivered in accordance with ECC standard processes. For Trading Participants without the capability of physical delivery, the obligations from the Close-out Agreement will also cover the EEX OTF Natural Gas Derivatives.Please note that EEX OTF Natural Gas Derivatives with optional physical settlement are subject to transparency and reporting requirements under MiFID II, MiFIR, EMIR, MAR and REMIT. The relevant MiFID/MiFIR Data Services Agreement, EMIR Data Services Agreement and REMIT Data Service Agreement cover both EEX Regulated Market and EEX OTF. In relation to clients that have these agreements in place the respective services will automatically be extended to these products. The additional EEX OTF Natural Gas Derivatives will be set up as follows in the ECC clearing system:HEBM   EEX PVB Natural Gas Month OTF Future EEX_FT_NATGAS_PVB_OTF  Delivery Product Group:  EEX_FE_NATGAS_PVB HEBQ EEX PVB Natural Gas Quarter OTF Future HEBS EEX PVB Natural Gas Season OTF Future HEBY EEX PVB Natural Gas Year OTF Future H1BM EEX CZ VTP Natural Gas Month OTF Future EEX_FT_NATGAS_OTE_OTF  Delivery Product Group:  EEX_FE_NATGAS_OTE  H1BQ EEX CZ VTP Natural Gas Quarter OTF Future H1BS EEX CZ VTP Natural Gas Season OTF Future H1BY EEX CZ VTP Natural Gas Year OTF Future  Detailed information on the product setup will be provided in the EEX OTF Contract Specifications and in the ECC Contract Detail File shortly.The transactions will be imported into the derivative clearing system C7 of ECC and integrated into the standard clearing processes for EEX OTF Natural Gas Derivatives.
